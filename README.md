# Wir-Goals 2.0

This is a simple goal-tracking application. It is an improved version of the previous app I made, called Wir-Goals.

I have made it primarily with the goal of practicing building React applications from scratch.
It may also be useful for those looking for a simple goal-tracking application.
Progress is stored in local storage.
